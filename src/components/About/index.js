  <Title>Nice to meet you</Title>
  I'm a software development with 7 years of experience on building reliable and production-ready products.
  As big fan of Javascript, I haven't moved into any other languages, but took positions doing several things, from being Full-Stack developer to Mobile (with React Native) or Desktop (with Electron).
  <br />
  I'm always eager for improvement and testing new technologies. I'd love to keep care of the code quality and architectural improvements, I enjoy working on small to medium teams on startup companies.
